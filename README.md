Song popularity prediction - Machine Learning project


The path to the files we used:
	->	song_data.csv 
	->	song_info.csv 


Basic Part: 
	->	logistic_reg_and_ensemble_basic.py
	->	lstm_basic.py
	->	perceptron_basic.py

The three files contain the codes for the algorithms in the basic part. 


Advanced Part: 
	->	logistic_reg_and_ensemble_advanced.py
	->	perceptron_advanced.py
	->	lstm_advanced.py
	->	resample_data.py

The three files contain the codes for the algorithms in the advanced part. 
The additional file contain the functions that resample the data (over and under sample) that we implemented.


Creative Part:
	->	logistic_reg_and_ensemble_creative.py
	->	perceptron_creative.py 
	->	lstm_creative.py
	->	syntethic_data_MUNGE.py

The three files contain the codes for the algorithms in the creative part. 
The additional file contain the functions that create new data by using MUNGU algorithm that we implemented.


	▪	For our unstructured classifiers we imported methods from open source libraries - sklearn, pandas and numpy
	▪	For our structured classifiers and imported methods from open source libraries - pystruct, torch, pandas, math, _collections and numpy
